## Growing Up

Before I begin, I wanted to give you all some background on myself. As a child growing up I had asthma and conventional seasonal allergies. I used to swim quite regularly and I believe that was the reason for my eventual cure for the asthma symptoms. Although allergies have been part of my life for as long as I could remember, I’ve never liked taking medications like Reactine. 

Over the past few years, I’ve been developing some seemingly odd new allergies to fruits like apples, blueberries, dragon fruit, and cherries. I used to eat these type of fruits all the time growing up so when I ate them and looked like this I was knew I needed to seek a professional. 

Here's an example:

## The Allergist
After my first incident of eating an apple and looking 50 years older in about 30 mins, I scheduled an appointment with an allergist and performed a standard allergy test. They test for allergens like tree pollens, animal dander, and dust by placing a grid of samples on the skin and pricking the areas of skin to allow the samples to come in contact with your blood. (Sounds horrid I know but it’s really not that bad). If you’re allergic to any of the samples, after about 20 mins, you can start to see signs of minor anaphylaxis, where your body reacts to the allergens by swelling. 

I mentioned to the allergist that I suspected I was allergic to apples. The standard test didn’t cover apples so he told me to wait a moment and that he would be right back. In a few minutes, he returned with a Granny Smith Apple and proceeded with some jokes about how we’re using his lunch for my test. He cut a piece of his apple, rubbed it on my skin and pricked the spot. Then the waiting began. 

## The Results 

From the results of the test it was concluded that I’m allergic to the following.

## Oral Allergy Syndrome

I learned that I had Oral Allergy Syndrome (OAS), which is a type of food allergy where the body confuses the allergen with tree pollens.

After learning by trial that the OAS also included blueberries, dragon fruit, peaches, and most recently plums, I decided that I should try and find a solution better than simply not eating them. 

## The Naturopath

That’s when I decided to see a Naturopath. It was the first time ever seeing a Naturopath so the experience was completely foreign to me. The first session was an hour and a half Q&A session, where she shared some background on her practice (Chinese and Western medicine) and she asked me about everything from my environment to my eating habits. She asked me if there were any specific things I wanted to remedy and I thought deeply about that question and mentioned the allergies and some eczema that I’ve been having on my neck and inner elbow.

After getting a thorough understanding of my environment and stresses, she proceed to explain how different systems in the body work before laying out the diagnosis and treatment.

Lesson on the Nervous System

> “The fight-or-flight response, also known as the acute stress response, refers to a physiological reaction that occurs in the presence of something that is terrifying, either mentally or physically. The response is triggered by the release of hormones that prepare your body to either stay and deal with a threat or to run away to safety.” 
[Source.] (https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-the-fight-or-flight-response-2795194)

The fight-or-flight response, which is part of the sympathetic nervous system, is what has helped us survive and stay alive. Its counterpart, the parasympathetic nervous system is responsible for “Rest and Digest” so when the danger is gone, the body is able to enter its regenerative and calming state.

## So what does all this mean?

When your body is in a fight-or-flight state, it uses its energy to survive rather than regenerate. So in order to self-heal, we need to get our bodies into a more relaxed state activating the parasympathetic nervous system.

>Side note, but one great way to get into this state is *meditation!*

She mentioned that based on the theory of Yin and Yang from traditional Chinese medicine, my eczema was linked to [Kidney Yang deficiency](http://www.shen-nong.com/eng/principles/kidneyyinyang.html). She shared a list of foods that I should try and add to my diet and others that I should refrain from. The list can be found online [here](https://acupuncture.rhizome.net.nz/acupuncture/dietary-therapy/yang-deficiency/).

## The treatment plan

The naturopath proposed the following 4 step treatment plan:

1. Decrease inflammation in stomach lining by increasing fibre
2. Rebalance nervous system
3. Increase nutrients
4. Improve Immune System

To be specific, she “prescribed” the following supplements for 3 months. 

*Note: She put together the most cost-effective plan that's wallet-friendly.*

* 2 tbsps of whole brown flax seeds freshly ground ([Herbie's Herbs](https://herbies-herbs.com/flax-p834?search=flax%20seed))
* 2 grams of Omega 3 (*4:1 EPA to DHA ratio*) per day with food
* 1 tsp of herbal tea blend per cup of boiling water, 3 cups per day
	* The tea blend composed of:
		* *Ocimum sanctum (15g)*
		* *Melissa officinalis (15g)*
		* *Avena sativa (10g)*
		* *Galium aparine (10g)*
		* *Arctium lappa (10g)*
		* *Urtica dioica (15g)*
* 400 mg of Magnesium bisglycinate before bed and 1 hour from other medications ([Noah's Natural Foods](https://www.noahsnaturalfoods.ca/canprev-magnesium-bis-glycinate-200-bonus-90-30-veg-caps/)) 

After 2 weeks of starting:

* Probiotics - HMF Forte - 2 caps/day

I’d love to see if it can help benefit you as well. I’ll be sure to give everyone an update after the treatment plan.
