Hi, I'm Ryan. I've had a placeholder website for some time now so I've decided to use this as a platform to share my learnings and experiences.

### Who is Ryan?

That's a great question -- thank you for asking.

I've always loved building things. From building physical things like my younger brothers LEGO's as a child, to building digital projects like websites, the journey and the challenge is what draws me in.

I'm eternally curious and maybe ask too many questions sometimes. 

Feel free to ask me a question by sending me an [email](mailto:ryangor7@gmail.com?Subject=Hello).
